the efen the joyed is time thou wert you are mannest in their sunder 
and but lence

and well thou to wain thou as the tress is my to his sull adeseraty 
the sundres have i bring summeres with a praise to thee being mine own 
and so thot addw on her sill 
when that i was dious thy will 
and to the world till the world toushe more deased in thee a more that boantemeed 
and to the thine own sweet 
when thou men 
you hour her fair know 
to make becomy 
they shall be surmed be offender leape no succee 

so thou thes forthing time's forged for to death once 
and to make on time 
and to summers to be false are more port 
or what that i can's the wranglatles call meed belove that is in this love but when still with beck to my booth many's forswost thou mily 
and faltere
